The range includes standard and isolator bases, sounder and sounder\/beacon bases as well as the unique time saver ceiling tile adaptor.\n\nThe addressable sounder base and sounder\/beacon base feature built-in line isolators, flash rate, tone and volume settings via the panel configuration software which means that either individual, zonal or global changes can be made with a single panel configuration download. Sounder and beacon can be programmed separatelly.\n\nMany of today’s buildings feature a false or suspended ceiling. Installation of fire detectors to this type of ceiling has been seen as both difficult and time consuming with the installation requiring the ceiling to be in place before the detector base and associated second fix can take place. By using the new Time Saver Ceiling Tile Adaptor the whole installation process has been made much easier.\n\nBASE FEATURES\n- Aesthetically discreet.\n- Superior performance and reliability.\n- Designed for rapid installation with a Snap-Fit feature.\n- Remote LED connection.\n- Addressable loop powered sounder and sounder\/beacon bases with built-in line isolators.\n- Time saver ceiling tile adaptor reduces installation time\non suspended ceilings by 30%..","hasPDF":"false","pageID":196},{"Title":"4B","Title2":"4 Inch Detector Base","stockcode":"517.050.041","InMenu":16,"ImageMini":"NULL","Image1":"NULL","Image2":"NULL","Image3":"NULL","Image4":"NULL","Image5":"NULL","long":"The new 4B 4 inch Detector Base is designed to snap-fit to the Ceiling Tile Adaptor or it can be screw fixed to a ceiling in the traditional manner.\n\nGeneral Features\n- Aesthetically discreet.\n- Superior performance and reliability.\n- Designed for rapid installation.\n- Remote LED connection.","hasPDF":"false","pageID":253},{"Title":"MUB-RV","Title2":"Universal 5 Inch Base with Relay","stockcode":"508.031.751","InMenu":16,"ImageMini":"NULL","Image1":"NULL","Image2":"NULL","Image3":"NULL","Image4":"NULL","Image5":"NULL","long":"The 5B is the most common base designed to fix directly to the ceiling or various common backboxes.
